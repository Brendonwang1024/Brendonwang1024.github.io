      <description>As you know, weâ€™re in our 6th unit of math. Recently, we have studied parentheses in equations, unneeded information, and two step problems. For a review, try this problem! Jackie, Jake, James, Jacob and Jane all saved specific amounts of money. Jane had $24. Jackie had $5.78 more than Jake. Jake had 2 times as much as James. James had $2.17 less than Jacob. Jacob had $18.39. How much money did Jackie have?</description>
