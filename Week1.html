<h1> The Oregon Trail </h1>
<p>In Mrs. Kaminoff’s class, we have started a unit where we learn about how it was like on the Oregon trail. Our class writes journal entries with slight twists Mrs. Kaminoff gives us to make the journey more interesting.
On Monday’s lesson, the Webster family’s wagon and supplies were tumbling down a hillside due to a mud slide. We discussed how we would replenish the Webster family’s food supplies. Luckily, their wagon was okay.</p>
